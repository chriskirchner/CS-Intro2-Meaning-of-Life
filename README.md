## Overview

Welcome to the Meaning of Life Game, where you turn questions into a key to unlock the 
meaning of life.  Beware of the evil Answers ("@") that steal away questions.

## HOW TO 
Walk through all the rooms to collect questions.
The second to last room will unlock all rooms that
close behind you, except for the very last room.
To unlock the last room, you need to go back to the first
room and convert 6 questions to get a key (*) upon walking into that room.
Pick up the key and use it to open up the door to
the last room where you will find the meaning of
life, blah.  Goodluck!
